    <h2 style="color:#FF0">Why is this site so "special"? What extra work was put into this?</h2>
    <p>This website, that you are currently on was written in raw HTML5 and CSS. What exactly does that mean? That's what Jake Lille, this group's web designer and programer had to figure out. He took online lessons and watching/reading countless tutorials until he created his first webpage. HTML5 and CSS are programing languages (if you couldn't tell by now). It's a lot more complicated than a simple click and drag editor that most children use today to "make" websites.</p>
<div id="Code"><a href="https://github.com/JakeDGator/HF_Project_2015"><h3 style="color:#0F0; font-family:Courier; margin:auto" align="center";><strong>Website Code</strong></h3></a> </div>
    <p><em>Over 20 hours of programming, revision and editing was taken place on the website. I had to do it all on my own time and effort due to the fact I was the only who took the initiative to learning. Alex and David (the other two group members) assisted by gathering videos and most research.</em></p>
