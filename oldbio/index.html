      Alan Turing’s amazing life as a leader began when he was born on the 23rd of June in 1912. He was an extremely bright child who, at a very young age excelled in both science and mathematics. Turing experienced hardships and many ups and downs during his life, which led him to turn to religion. Eventually, however, he became disenchanted with religion and came to the conclusion that everything is basically materialistic.
During his career as an academic, he published many things.  He attended the distinguished Kings College and got his doctorate from Princeton University. One of his works was about the Turing machines. These machines were fantastically capable of solving any mathematical problem. Later, he improved this machine to the point where it had the capacity to solve what he called “unsolvable” mathematical problems.</p>
<p>As a leader in his field, he went to England to help the armed forces there against the Germans. He helped to break the German codes within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park. Turing had specified an electromechanical machine that could help break Enigma, a sophisticated message system, more effectively than the Polish Enigma Machine. He called his new enigma machine “Bombe”. After the war, he continued to be a leader in his now known field of computer technology.  Turing was the first person to design a stored-program computer in England. This is known as one of the earliest true computers.  Mr. Turing called it the Manchester Mark 1.</p>
<p>Turing was additionally a leader in the field of Artificial Intelligence and his career lead him into being even a more abstract thinker. He developed a test for Artificial Intelligence called the Turing Test and he also worked with another scientist and began writing one of the first chess computer programs ever devised. The technological accomplishments of this great leader were prodigious and paved the way for future generations to build upon them, ultimately making the computers we use everyday in our world.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mr. Turing died tragically of poisoning at a young age in 1954. He had eaten an apple laced with cyanide, a very potent poison. Some believe that he was a security risk, knowing all that he did, and that he was the victim of assassination. Luckily, he has still been given what we refer to as proper credit and accolades for his innovative thinking and contributions to the computer, mathematical and scientific world.  He was ahead of his time with his innovative thinking and concepts. He was a true leader of the technological age and has served as a basis for work of which he could have only dreamed. He was a true inspiration to many others in his field who came after him.</p>
