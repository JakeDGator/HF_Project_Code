Most people are not aware of the past existence of Alan Turing, a true genius to our society. You know that computer, phone, tablet or
whatever electronic device you are viewing this webpage on? That's thanks to yours truly, Alan Turing. Turing invented AI, or
Artificial Intelligence. Believe it or not, humans are intelligent (yes, even those moron drivers on the street). Artificial
Intelligence is practically like a human, but with a man-made brain. It has limitations, but without it, our devices and services such
as Paypal, Amazon, eBay, Servers in general would sieze to exist without the invention of "The Turing Machine", which theoretically was
the first computer. Not only did he revolutionize the tech industry, he also changed the world by the outcome of World War II.
His machine was the first to have the ability to decrypt messages from the Germans, which led to great success for the British preventing
invasions and intercepting top secret messages about battle strategies and tactics. Without him, how would the world be?
